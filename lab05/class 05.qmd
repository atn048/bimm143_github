## Background

There are lot's of ways to make figures in R. These include so-called "base R" graphics (e.g. `plot()`) and tones of add-on packages like **ggplot2**.

For example here we make the same plot with both:

```{r}
head(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
First I need to install the package with the command `install.package()`. 

**N.B.** We never run an install cmd in a quarto code chunk or we will end up re-installing packages many many times - which is not what we want!

Every time we want to use one of these "add-on" packages we need to load it up in R with the `library()` function:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cars)
```

Every ggplot needs at least 3 things:

- The **data**, the suff you want plotted
- The **aes**thetics, how the data map to the plot 
- The **geom**etry, the type of plot 

```{r}
ggplot(cars) +
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point()
```

Add a line to better show relationship between speed and dist

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cars) +
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(
    title="Stopping distance of old cars", 
       subtitle = "Data from the `cars` object", 
       x="Speed (mph)",
       y="Distance (ft)"
  )
p
```

render it out
p

```{r}
p + theme_bw()
```

## Gene expression plot

We can read the input data from the class website 
```{r}
url <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_S20/class-material/up_down_expression.txt"
genes <- read.delim(url)
head(genes)
```
```{r}
table( genes$State )
```


A first version plot
```{r}
ggplot(genes) +
  aes(Condition1, Condition2)+
  geom_point()
  
```

```{r}
genes$State
```
Version 2 let's color by `State` so we can see the "up" and "down" genes compared to all the "unchanging" genes

```{r}
ggplot(genes) +
  aes(Condition1, Condition2, col=State) +
  geom_point()
```

Version 3 plot, let's modify the default colors to something we like 

```{r}
ggplot(genes) +
  aes(Condition1, Condition2, col=State) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual( values=c("lightgreen", 
                               "lightblue", 
                               "lightyellow")) +
labs(
  x="Control (no drug)", 
     y="Drug",
     title="Gene Expression Changes upon GLP-1 drug"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
nrow(genes)
```

##Going Further 
Lets have a look at the famous **gapminder** dataset

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/gapminder/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv"

gapminder <- read.delim(url)
```

```{r}
head(gapminder, 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, col=continent) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)
```

Let's "facet" (i.e. make a separate plot) by continent rather than the big hot mess above.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, col=continent) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```
## Custom plots

How big is this gapminder dataset?
```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```
I want to "filter" down to a subset of this data. I will use the **dplyr** package to help me.

First I need to install it and then load it up...
`install.packages("dplyr")` and then `library(dplyr)`

```{r}
library(dplyr)

gapminder_2007 <- filter(gapminder, year==2007)
head(gapminder_2007)
```

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year==2007, country=="Ireland")
```
```{r}
filter(gapminder, year==2007, country=="United States")
```

> Q. Make a plot comparing 1977 and 2007 for all countries 

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year %in% c(1977,2007))
```
```{r}
gapminder_1977 <- gapminder %>% filter(year==1977 | year==2007)

ggplot(gapminder_1977) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent), alpha=0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~year)
```
